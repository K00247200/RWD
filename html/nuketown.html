	<p> Veterans of the franchise know Nuketown well, but in 1984, 
	it turns out the original testing ground for the most powerful 
	bomb on the planet had a sister site: one that has been lost to 
	time until a few curious travelers turned it into their own. 
	personal sanctuary.</p>
<br>
	<p>	As a precursor to the start of Season One of Black Ops Cold War, 
	Nuketown ’84 is now available for all players for free, continuing the
	tradition of bringing one of Call of Duty’s most iconic Multiplayer locales
	into the 6v6 map rotation. </p>
<br>
	<p>	Whether you’re a veteran to these hallowed grounds or a fresh-faced 
	recruit, here’s what you need to know about Nuketown ’84: </p>
<br>
	<h3> Lay of the Land </h3>
	<p>	Nuketown ’84 is a fast and frenetic 6v6 map set in a nuclear testing 
	ground modeled on an idyllic American neighborhood.</p>
<br>
	<p>	Although the layout may look familiar to fans of the original Black 
	Ops iteration of Nuketown, this particular location in the Nevada desert 
	has been designated “Site B.” In 1954, Site B was primed for “the big test,”
	but a last-minute government budget decision decommissioned the site. 
	For 30 years, this Nuketown remained dormant… until in 1984, 
	a group of social misfits travelling through no man’s land discovered 
	the site and made it their home. Decorating the site with graffiti and 
	various junk collected in their travels, they turned this quaint cul-de-sac 
	into a personal desert refuge from a world filled with wars, anxiety, and 
	“The Man.” </p>
<br>
	<p> The map’s primary feature is the two iconic model homes facing one 
	another on opposite ends of the cul-de-sac: a teal one on the west, which
	has the iconic Nuketown sign out front, and a yellow one to the east.</p>
<br>
	<p> Outside of their faded paintjobs superimposed with graffiti, 
	each home has a spacious living room to welcome you in through the 
	front door. Follow the staircase up to the second level or pass through 
	the kitchen in the rear, which has an exit out to the backyard and another 
	to open attached garage with an alternate route out to the back.</p>
<br>
	<p>Take the staircase, and you’ll find yourself on a landing 
	looking into the remains of a study room, which leads to a bedroom 
	looking out over the cul-de-sac and a rear balcony with a staircase 
	down to the back lawn. In each home’s backyard, you’ll find what was 
	once the garden area, which acts as the initial spawn point in team game 
	modes, as well as a small shed that can be used as cover. Long-time 
	Nuketown fans will feel right at home.	</p>
<br>
	<p> A graffiti-laden school bus and a delivery truck with an open 
	cargo hold occupy the otherwise open street at the center of the map.
	At the end of the cul-de-sac to the north is a rust bucket parked on the 
	lawn of a third home with crates stacked towards the direction of the 
	yellow house. Opposite this home, past the bus and truck, you’ll find 
	a 4x4 among sandbags with a small bit of tarmac before the closed-off 
	entrance. </p>

<br>
	<h3> Nuketown '84 Minimap </h3>
<br>
	<h3> Basic Strategies </h3>
<br>
	<p> Success in Nuketown ‘84 relies on aggressive tactical play and a 
	strong sense of map awareness. In game modes where respawning is enabled, 
	always keep an eye out for where the enemy is coming from to know when to 
	push forward or take cover behind your current position. </p>
<br>
	<p> In either house, SMGs, shotguns, and melee weapons will serve you well.
	The garages offer a more secluded point of attack toward enemies in the 
	middle, with an easy escape in the front or back when you need to get out 
	fast. </p>
<br>
	<p> Assault and tactical rifles perform well in the middle and in the 
	backyards where mid-range sightlines dominate. They’re also excellent 
	for firing out of either house, though you may struggle without a strong 
	close-range backup when an enemy charges up the stairs for revenge. </p>
<br>
	<p> Other points of interest include the long sightlines along the sides 
	of the map and around the 4x4, where you can position near the vehicle for 
	cover, and take out enemies pouring in from the immediate left and right 
	paths as well as those coming down the center. </p>
<br>
	<h3> Scorestreak Field Guide </h3>
<br>
	<p> On a small map with this much exterior space, plenty of Scorestreaks 
	can be deadly in the hands of a capable Operator. </p>
<br>
	<p> Just starting out? You can’t go wrong with the RC-XD, Spy Plane, 
	and Counter Spy Plane. Played at the right time, the RC-XD can land 
	multi-kills on clustered groups of enemies. As for the Spy Plane, thanks
	to Nuketown ’84’s small size, that extra intel can give your team the 
	advantage in overall map awareness. That advantage only grows when you 
	deploy the Counter Spy Plane, which scrambles enemy mini-maps and disables 
	enemy SAM Turrets. </p>
<br>
	<p> For mid-range streaks, a Sentry Turret placed to the side of 
	either house could help you land a handful of kills down the middle 
	of the map. As for higher-end Scorestreaks, such as the Chopper Gunner, 
	remember to check each home’s garden area for launcher-toting enemies 
	hanging back to clear the skies. </p>
<br>
	<p> In Domination, the A and C zones sit in the teal and yellow home’s 
	back yards, respectively, with the B zone close to the sedan at top center. </p>
<br>
	<p> Given B’s position, it’ll usually be under a constant barrage of 
	lethal grenades, so consider equipping Flak Jacket and, using the Law
	Breaker Wildcard and Tactical Mask simultaneously to mitigate their effects.
	You could also throw in a Trophy System Field Upgrade for even more 
	protection in your loadouts. In general, the more you can resist or 
	intercept incoming explosives, the better you can hold down that objective. </p>
<br>
	<p> Hardpoint can turn Nuketown ’84 into pure chaos, as both teams will 
	be focused on a singular point of an already compact map. The same Perk 
	tips apply here as in Domination, with the addition that short-range 
	weapons are highly effective at breaking and holding Hardpoints in either 
	home. </p>
<br>
	<p> On the flipside, Search and Destroy drastically changes pace, 
	as more methodical plays will be more effective due to a lack of respawns. 
	Be careful of snipers that may lock down the side yards or hole up in one 
	of the bedroom windows, as they could easily give their team an early 
	advantage with a speedy elimination. </p>

<br>
	<h3> 10 Tips </h3>
<br>
	<p> <em>10. Trouble in CQB Paradise.</em> While it may be tempting to equip an SMG 
	and a shotgun to get up-close and personal with the enemy match after match, 
	the rifle categories and LMG have their own advantages. Maintain your distance 
	from Operators using close-range weapons who dare to travel into mid-map, 
	or aim into either house where they are poised to dominate any intruders. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>9. Fire from the Hip.</em> On a map where you’ll often suddenly find yourself 
	face to face with an enemy, it may be better to configure weapons for better 
	hip fire accuracy. That way, you’ll have a chance at landing 
	the initial panic shot before finishing the job by aiming down sights. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>8. Bring a Launcher.</em> The fencing behind either house offers a mostly-safe
	haven from which to attack aerial Scorestreaks. Equip a launcher and help your
	team — and your Scorestreak progress — by taking down enemy threats. 
	Expect a lot of them. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>7. The RC-XD: A Hidden Gem.</em> Given the limited amount of space on 
	Nuketown ’84, this low-end Scorestreak could be an invaluable tool for turning 
	the tide of battle. Expert drivers may even find a way to get this 
	remote-controlled car across the map quickly safely and deal a devastating 
	surprise attack. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>6. SAM Turret Deployed.</em> If you’d like to support your team without 
	taking your eyes off the field, consider the SAM Turret field upgrade. 
	It’s not as consistent as a launcher, but it can do a lot of work against 
	enemy aerial Scorestreaks in the time it’s out. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>5. Grenades Aplenty.</em> Equipment of all shapes and sizes should be used 
	freely on Nuketown ’84. Even Smoke Grenades can be used to great effect, 
	concealing your movement through the middle when you need to rush across the map. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>4. Don’t Forget Your Mask and Jacket.</em> No matter if you are aiming for weapon 
	kills or lobbing plenty of lethals yourself, the Flak Jacket and Tactical Mask 
	Perks are near essentials when infiltrating Nuketown ’84. Leave them off your 
	loadouts at your own risk of an explosive death or frequent disorientation. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>3. Hit the Deck!</em> On such a small and frenetic map, there are bound to be 
	a handful of players using Proximity Mines in hopes of landing kills against 
	unsuspecting enemies. If you ever set one off, crouch to avoid taking lethal damage. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>2. On the Ledge.</em> There’s a small ledge protruding just under the second story 
	window of either house. This can be used to get a better angle at action happening at 
	mid-map, or you can climb up from the outside as another way to counter a bedroom sniper. </p>
<br>
	<p> <em>1. Speed is King.</em> Nuketown ’84 is built for aggressive play. If you’re generally a 
	more cautious player, this is the map to get out of your comfort zone. Keep pushing to tip 
	the balance until you see how aggressive play can be the best defense of all. </p>
<br>
	<p> Execute the mission. </p>
